# Quick React Hearts
https://img.shields.io/badge/<Made With>-<React>-<red>

This project was done as a simple react app to practice making reusable components. This challenge is in response to my code inscructor's video: [quick react hearts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuyoQHk8Tn8).

## Features

quick-react-hearts renders a card component shaped and colored like a heart. The challenge given was to change where on the screen the heart or hearts was to be rendered. My answer to this challenge was to create a function that would generate a random number of hearts and coordinates within the view for the hearts to be rendered.
